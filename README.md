## VaxxStance@IberLEF 2021


### Task Description

The aim of VaxxStance@IberLEF 2021 is to detect stance in social media on a very controversial and trendy topic, namely, the Antivaxxers movement, in two languages: Basque and Spanish. Following previous tasks (Mohammad et al. 2016, Taule et al. 2018, Cignarella et al. 2020), the aim is determining whether a given tweet expresses an AGAINST, FAVOR or NEUTRAL (NONE) stance towards a previously defined topic.

In the two examples given in Figure 1, the tweet on the left expresses a FAVOR stance towards vaccines whereas the one on the right conveys an AGAINST stance.

As the task contains tweets in two different languages, we would like to propose the following participation tracks for each language (Basque and Spanish):

1. Close Track: Language-specific evaluation. Only the provided data for each of the languages is allowed. There are two evaluation settings:
1.1 Textual: Only provided tweets in the target language can be used for development.
1.2 Contextual: Text plus given Twitter-related information will be used by the participants. Contextual information refers to features related with user-based Twitter information: friends, retweets, followers, replies, etc. (Cignarella et al. 2020).
2. Open Track: Participants can use any kind of data. The main objective consists of exploring data augmentation and knowledge transfer techniques for cross-lingual stance detection.
3. Zero-shot Track: Texts (tweets) of the target language cannot be used for training. The main objective is to explore how to develop systems that do not have access to text in the target language, especially using Twitter-related information.

Additionally, and inspired by the recently held SardiStance shared task (Cignarella et al. 2020), the Close Track will include two evaluation settings per language: Textual and Contextual. Furthermore, the Open and Zero-shot tracks will include only one evaluation setting per language, one for Spanish and one for Basque.

Participants can submit their systems to any of the tracks, but it will be compulsory to participate in both languages for the chosen track. Therefore, if a team only takes part in the Close Track then that team would have to submit runs for both Basque and Spanish in each evaluation setting, Textual and Contextual. Similarly, to participate in the Zero-shot or Open tracks then runs must be submitted for both Basque and Spanish languages.
